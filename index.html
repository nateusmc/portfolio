      The purpose of the Mood Cloud project is to provide teachers and students a way to enhance their emotional intelligence, commonly referred to as EI or EQ, and better connect interpersonally. Often,many students struggle to express or track their emotional state, making it difficult for teachers to adequately gauge their emotional well-being. Mood Cloud provides a means for students to track their moods overtime, and observe them reflected in a word cloud. Students may also log comments about their emotional state for later reference, helping to gain further insight into their ongoing emotional well-being. Students may also share their moods with their teachers and alert them during times of crisis or despair. Connected teachers receive up-to-date alerts from students who submit critical moods, or alert their teacher directly via a panic/alert button. Additionally, teachers or students may open an instant message alert window to respond to any dire student needs.

      Kurikaeshi (Japanese for 'repetition') is an app allowing users to learn and retain Japanese vocabulary by means of a spaced repetition algorithm. Kurikaeshi stores a wealth of information, including pronunciation and example usages, for each word, and tracks the user's progress as their grasp of new vocabulary words increases.

      I Built an app that uses a 3rd party API to gather current latitude and longitude coordinates for the International Space Station. Then I developed a function that will use that data along with other latitude and longitude coordinates to calculate the distance from the input coordinates and the ISS current location. This app currently will give you the distance between the ISS and the user's location as well as the distance between the ISS and each crew member aboard expedition 54's Hometown so they can see how far away they are from home.

<!-- About me -->

<div class='about-me-label'>
  <p>
    <b>About Me:</b>
  </p>
</div>

<div class='about-me'>
  <p>
    I am a <b>full stack web developer</b> from the <b>Dallas, Texas</b> area. I am most fluent in the <b>MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)</b>, however I love to learn and am always trying new things and searching for the next challenge so I am definitely not limited to just this stack. My ideal work environment would be somewhere where I can contribute to a meaninful project that impacts people's lives in a great way. <b>I love working in teams</b> and have leadership abilites as well from my experience in the <b>United States Marine Corps</b>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    In my free time I like to learn new development languages, libraries and frameworks, as well as play some strategy video games in my down time such as HearthStone. I like that these games keep my mind moving and make me think as well as giving me some down time to relax so I don't get burnt out trying to learn so many new things and master old skills. I also love spending time in the mountains and off-road looking at stars, wildlife, and enjoying nature in general.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    The thing I love most about development is that I never get bored and am constantly facing new challenges and bettering myself. There is always something out there to learn in this industry and I love the challenge of learning as much of it as I can and mastering the technologies I enjoy most. I also have a backround in <b>SEO, online marketing, ad campaign management such as facebook ads</b>, etc which directly correlates into my web development experience as the 2 skillsets mesh together quite nicely.
